/**
 * Github release asset.
 *
 * @author Carlos Miranda (miranda.cma@gmail.com)
 * @version $Id$
 * @since 0.8
 * @see <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/">Releases API</a>
 * @todo #282 Implement a Smart decorator for ReleaseAsset for the purposes of
 *  JSON parsing. This class should be able to return the various attributes of
 *  the JSON response for fetching comments, such as the ID, commit ID, URL, and
 *  comment body. Smart should also be able to handle editing the attributes
 *  of an existing comment by using
 *  {@link JsonPatchable#patch(javax.json.JsonObject)}. Also include an example
 *  of how to do this in the Javadoc comment above. You can refer to
 *  {@link PublicKey} on how to do this.
 * @todo #282 We should be able to fetch a release asset's binary contents. See
 *  http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#get-a-single-release-asset
 *  for details on how this needs to be done. The ReleaseAsset interface should
 *  be able to expose this function through a method, which we can name
 *  something like "content", "body" or "raw", whichever is most appropriate.
 *  I'm not sure what the return type should be at the moment but it will likely
 *  be either a byte array or a stream implementation.
